				<h3> Well, Where shall I start? </h3>
				<div id="aboutmemaintext"> <p> My name is Luke and I was born on the 5th of July 1996 in the city of Bath. At the age of 4 I started my education at my local primary school, Westfield Primary. From finishing primary school I moved onto secondary education at Norton Hill School. Here I studied for 5 years, where I also undertook my GCSE. My most notable grades came in Mathematics (C), Science (C) and IT (computing) (Merit). After finishing my GCSE I decided to go straight to college studying computing. I started my college journey on a 1 year Level 3 course in Computing and Systems Development, I achieved a pass grade at the end of the year and progressed onto the Level 4 course.The same applied here, It was a 1 year course and I achieved a pass grade at the end of the course, resulting in progressing onto, what would be, my final year at college where I studied and passed a Level 5 Computing and Systems Development course. <br> <br>

From leaving college I decided I wanted a job within the IT industry. However, with no luck of finding such a job I decided that I had to make my, at the time, part-time job working in a warehouse into my full-time job while still searching for an IT job. A year down the line and still no luck I came across a company called Mayden that were going to be running an academy for people that want to become software developers. With luck on my side this time, I applied for 1 of 6 positions that were being advertised and finally after a countless amount of different interviews with Mayden. I am lucky enough to currently be part of the Mayden Academy and am thoroughly enjoying the experience.  </p>  </div>

			<div class="aboutmemaintext"> <p> When it comes to my interests and hobbies, I love anything that is car related. I have my own car, Limited Edition Vauxhall Corsa, that I absolutely love due to it being my first car. However I already have plans for replacing it with something more powerful and potentially project material, so that I can modify it both in looks and power. <br> <br>

I also own 2 RC (radio controlled) cars that I love using. Both of them were bought as flat pack kits that took me around 2 weeks each to assemble. The first one I bought uses an electric motor for power and is reasonably quick. The Second car uses a Nitro engine and runs on Nitro fuel which is used in the same way you would use petrol in a real life car. Although the Nitro car is my favourite it takes a lot more maintenance due to the engine seizing if left unattended. <br> <br>

Also, in my spare time I enjoy playing with computers ,be it, computer games or the actual computer components. When it comes to computer games im not very good at them. So, I found out that I enjoy watching other people play the games much more than me playing the same games myself. <br> <br>

Thats me! </p> </div>
